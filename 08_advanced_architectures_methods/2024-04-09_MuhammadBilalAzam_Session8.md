LLMs can be very useful in NLP for tasks like summarizing, translating, and answering questions. Researchers can also analyze scientific literature, can summarize large volumes of scientific papers and extract key insights. However, while considering LLM applications in NLP and in scientific literature, it is also important to consider various metrics such as: 

- The quality of generated summaries can be evaluated using metrics like ROUGE scores to compare the generated summary to reference summaries to measure overlap. 
- Assess the coherence and fluency of generated text, using metric like perplexity, to ensure summaries are logically structured and grammatically correct.
- Compare the generated summaries to original scientific literature for relevancy.
- Such models should be generalize across various domains and scientific disciplines. It should be robust and applicable beyond specific domains. 
- Scalability is also an important factor for the model to process large volumes of text efficiently.

These assessments will help in improving and evaluating LLMs systematically. These will also provide insight about strengths and weaknesses in this context.
